## Developers Guide for Maintenance



## Publishing to PyPI

We publish each package separately. After you merge your `sub-main` branch to `main,` you can publish your documents and Python package through release. To do this, you need to update the version number in the package's `pyproject.toml`. Then, you create a release with the format of `package_name-v.x.y.z,` where x, y, and z are for version numbers. For example, if you want to publish `qadence-model` with version 1.2.5, you must put `model-v1.2.5` as your release name.
