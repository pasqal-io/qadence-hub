# Qadence-Hub


**Qadence-Hub** is a Github monorepo that hosts multiple Python packages developed under the **Qadence** initiative. It is structured to support independent development, testing, and deployment of each quantum features while maintaining a unified development environment.

## ðŸ“¦ Qadence extension packages

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `qadence-commons` | Shared libraries for Qadenceâ€‹|
| `qadence-mitigation` | Tools for error mitigation in quantum circuit execution|
| `qadence-measurement` | Interfaces for executing and analyzing quantum measurement|
| `qadence-model` | Quantum ML models built on variational quantum circuits|

## Publishing to PyPI

We publish each package separately. After you merge your `sub-main` branch to `main,` you can publish your documents and Python package through release. To do this, you need to update the version number in the package's `pyproject.toml`. Then, you create a release with the format of `package_name-v.x.y.z,` where x, y, and z are for version numbers. For example, if you want to publish `qadence-model` with version 1.2.5, you must put `model-v1.2.5` as your release name.
