# Measurement

Sample-based measurement protocols are fundamental tools for the prediction and estimation of a quantum state as the result of NISQ programs executions. Their resource efficient implementation is a current and active research field. Currently, quantum state tomography is implemented in qadence-measurement.

**Qadence-Measurement** is a Python package that provides measurement post-processing for Qadence. **Measurement** documentations is [here](https://pasqal-io.github.io/qadence-hub/qadence-measurement/latest/)
