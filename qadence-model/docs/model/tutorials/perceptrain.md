# What is Perceptrain?

`Perceptrain` is a lightweight and flexible training framework built to simplify model training — from local CPU to multi-GPU distributed environments. It is especially suited for research and prototyping, offering modularity and plug-and-play components such as optimizers, loggers, and callbacks.

## What does Perceptrain offer?

Key Functionalities:
	• Seamless multi-GPU / multi-node training via Accelerator abstraction
	• Built-in support for both gradient-based and gradient-free optimization
	• Easy experiment tracking with TensorBoard and MLflow
	• YAML or Python-based configuration via TrainConfig
	• Customizable training loop via Trainer and callback hooks

Whether you’re developing a deep learning model or experimenting with new training techniques, `Perceptrain` helps you iterate faster and more reliably.
